Description
===========

Android library project to customize the Holo theme with a custom accent color.

It currently supports Android 3.0+ projects (for the moment). Each theme defined in the project corresponds to a default android theme:
- Theme.Holo > Theme.HoloAccent
- Theme.Holo.Light > Theme.HoloAccent.Light
- Theme.Holo.Light.DarkActionBar > Theme.HoloAccent.Light.DarkActionBar

The library is still in an early development stage. 


Getting Started
===============

Before starting you can install the [sample app](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.negusoft.holoaccent.example) from the Play Store to get a quick look at the features.

For details on how to set up the project and technical information, you can visit the [wiki page](https://github.com/negusoft/holoaccent/wiki).

Coming Up Next...
=================

Next, the objective is to support older versions of android. For this purpose, the idea is to extend the project to support ActionBarSherlock and ActionBarCompat.

And finally, a lot of testing, documentation... still a lot of work to do.
